   Sustainable FSA house-style kit · ui/drawer.js · v0.2.1
   The control drawer: a real column of the app's map row on desktop, an
   off-canvas overlay with a scrim on compact viewports.

   ES module, no build step. Imports only core/core.js.

     import { initDrawer }
       from 'https://sustainable-fsa.com/style/v0.2.1/ui/drawer.js';

   Markup is the shell documented in theme/sfsa-theme.css § "Control drawer" —
   this module manages those elements, it does not build them:

     <main>                            <!-- display:flex; position:relative -->
       <aside id="drawer" class="sfsa-drawer" aria-label="Map controls">
         <div class="sfsa-drawer-scroll">
           <section class="sfsa-drawer-section"> … </section>
         </div>
       </aside>
       <!-- NEXT SIBLING of the drawer: the theme selects the tab's closed
            position and its chevron direction through
            `.sfsa-drawer.is-closed + .sfsa-drawer-tab`. -->
       <button id="drawer-tab" class="sfsa-drawer-tab" aria-expanded="true"
               aria-controls="drawer" aria-label="Hide controls"> … </button>
       <div id="drawer-scrim" class="sfsa-drawer-scrim" hidden aria-hidden="true"></div>
       <div id="map-frame"> … </div>

     const drawerCtl = initDrawer({
       drawer:     document.getElementById('drawer'),
       tab:        document.getElementById('drawer-tab'),   // desktop handle
       toggle:     document.getElementById('btn-drawer'),   // navbar hamburger
       scrim:      document.getElementById('drawer-scrim'),
       storageKey: 'sfsa-<app>-drawer',
       onToggle:   (open, { compact }) => { … },
     });

   TWO SURFACES, ONE MODULE. On desktop the drawer is a FIXTURE: a column of the
   row, part of the page, and collapsing it gives its width to the map. Under
   compact it is a LAYER: an overlay over the map with a scrim, which is why
   only the compact half takes focus, raises a scrim, and answers Escape. Every
   one of those differences is decided from the live `viewport` helper, never
   from a boot snapshot — a phone rotates, and a desktop window gets dragged
   narrow.

   The drawer's own accessible name is the app's (`aria-label` on the element).
   The TOGGLES' names are this module's: both are icon-only, both carry
   `aria-expanded`, and both get the swapped `aria-label` from `labels` — synced
   in the same call that flips `.is-closed`, so the accessible state cannot
   drift from the geometry (HOUSE-STYLE §5.7, the disclosure sibling of the
   aria-pressed idiom).

   REGISTRATION ORDER: INIT THIS BEFORE ui/card.js
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────
   One Escape dismisses exactly one layer, top-down, and the layers coordinate
   through `event.defaultPrevented` (ui/card.js § ESCAPE PRECEDENCE). Every
   handler in that contract is on `document`, and listeners on the SAME node run
   in REGISTRATION ORDER — whoever called addEventListener first sees the key
   first. The compact drawer sits at --z-drawer (70), above the detail surface at
   --z-detail (60), so `initDrawer` must run BEFORE `initDetailCard` or a single
   Escape would close the card underneath an open drawer and leave the drawer up.
   Modal `<dialog>`s are outside the ordering: they hold the browser's top layer
   and every handler here stands down for them.

   MAP RESIZE IS NOT THE KIT'S JOB
   ───────────────────────────────
   Opening or closing the desktop fixture changes the map container's width, and
   MapLibre has to be told. That is deliberately not wired here — the kit does
   not know the app has a map, or which of several it is. `onToggle` is the seam,
   and the recipe is:

     onToggle: (open, { compact }) => {
       if (!compact) {
         const settle = () => { map.resize(); zoomFloor.refresh(); };
         // AFTER the slide: the theme animates margin-left over --transition
         // (0.2s), and a resize measured mid-slide reads a width the container
         // is about to leave — which is how you get a letterboxed canvas.
         if (reducedMotion()) settle(); else setTimeout(settle, 240);
       }
       pushState();
     }

   Under reduced motion the CSS blanket clamps the transition to ~0ms, so the
   240ms wait would be a visible stall: resize immediately instead. Read
   `reducedMotion()` at call time, not at wiring time (WCAG 2.3.3).

   ── Attribution ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Ported from mt-climate-office/mesonet-explorer (MIT) — the `#sidebar` CSS and
   app.js's `setSidebarOpen` / sidebar wiring / `onViewportChange` block. Deltas
   from that source:

     1. ES module with a named export, and generic: `.sfsa-drawer` rather than
        one app's `#sidebar`, with the state class on the DRAWER (`.is-closed`)
        instead of on `<body>` (`body.sidebar-closed`) — a page may hold two.
     2. ARIA on BOTH toggles. The original syncs `aria-expanded`, `aria-label`
        and `title` on the edge handle but sets only `aria-expanded` on the
        hamburger, so the compact button's name stays frozen at "Show controls"
        while it is showing an open drawer.
     3. NEW: Escape participation. The original drawer answers no key at all, so
        on a phone the overlay is pointer-dismiss-only. Here Escape closes it
        when — and only when — it is compact and open, yielding to a handled
        event and to an open modal `<dialog>`, and marking the key consumed so
        the layers below stand down.
     4. NEW: focus management, the ui/card.js pattern (guarded opener capture,
        move in on open, put it back on close). The original moves no focus, so
        the compact overlay opens with the reader's cursor still underneath the
        scrim and closes leaving it nowhere.
     5. NEW: a closed drawer leaves the tab order. The theme transitions
        `visibility` with the slide, and this module moves focus out BEFORE that
        lands. The original's closed sidebar keeps its whole control set
        tab-reachable off-screen — a keyboard user tabs through invisible
        controls at every width.
     6. Compact NEVER persists, and entering compact force-closes. Same policy
        as the original, but the desktop preference is also remembered in memory
        so a rotation cannot lose a URL-driven `startOpen` or a session where
        localStorage is unavailable.
     7. `layoutControls()` is NOT ported: moving controls between the drawer and
        the navbar by breakpoint is app-specific, and this fleet's apps author
        their drawer sections statically in HTML instead.
     8. Map resize is the caller's, through `onToggle` (see above). The original
        calls `map.resize()` from inside the setter.
