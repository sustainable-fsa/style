   Sustainable FSA house-style kit · ui/card.js · v0.1.0
   The county detail card: a docked panel over the map that becomes a bottom
   sheet on compact viewports.

   ES module, no build step. Imports only core/core.js.

     import { initDetailCard }
       from 'https://sustainable-fsa.com/style/v0.1.0/ui/card.js';

   Markup is the shell documented in theme/sfsa-theme.css § "Detail card" —
   this module manages that element, it does not build it:

     <div class="sfsa-card" id="county-card" aria-labelledby="card-title" hidden>
       <div class="sfsa-card-head">
         <h2 class="sfsa-card-title" id="card-title">County</h2>
         <button type="button" class="card-close" id="card-close"
                 aria-label="Close county details">×</button>
       </div>
       <div class="sfsa-card-body"> … </div>
     </div>

     const cardCtl = initDetailCard({
       card:     document.getElementById('county-card'),
       closeBtn: document.getElementById('card-close'),
       onClose:  () => { selectedId = null; repaint(); pushState(); },
     });
     cardCtl.open();

   The card is where the CHOROPLETH GETS ITS NUMBER (HOUSE-STYLE §6): colour is
   never the sole channel, and on a county map the readout in this card is the
   cheapest and best redundancy. Filling it is the app's job; keeping it
   accessible is this module's.

   WHY NOT <dialog> — the documented exception
   ───────────────────────────────────────────
   `showModal()` puts the element in the browser's top layer, traps focus, and
   makes everything behind it inert. On a map app that would kill the map: the
   user could no longer pan, zoom, hover another county, or use the search box
   while a county is open — and those are exactly the things you do WITH a
   county open. So this is `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="false"` +
   `tabindex="-1"`, with the focus management written out by hand here:
   capture the opener, move focus in on open, put it back on close. Same
   exception the mco-web-style exemplar documents on its station card
   (exemplar/index.html: "NOT a <dialog>: showModal() would trap focus and kill
   map interaction"), and the same reason.

   ── Attribution ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Focus management ported from mt-climate-office/mco-web-style (MIT) —
   exemplar/app.js `openStation` / `closeCard` / the document-level Escape
   handler. Deltas from that source:

     1. ES module with a named export; the card shell is generic (any docked
        detail surface), not station-specific.
     2. The opener capture is guarded: re-opening for a SECOND feature while
        the card is already open no longer overwrites the remembered opener
        with the card itself (the exemplar's `_cardOpener =
        document.activeElement` on every open loses the real opener as soon as
        focus is inside the card).
     3. Escape yields to a handled event (`defaultPrevented`) so a combobox
        dropdown and this card can share one Escape key — see ui/search.js §
        ESCAPE PRECEDENCE — and MARKS the key consumed when it is this card
        that closes, so the layers below can yield in turn.
     4. NEW: the compact bottom-sheet height stamp (`--sheet-h`), which the
        theme's MapLibre corner controls and toast lift by. MCO has no card
        component and no sheet.
   ========================================================================== */

import { viewport } from '../core/core.js';

/* The sheet height is measured twice: once synchronously (the read forces the
   layout the unhide just invalidated) and once on the next frame, which
   catches a late web-font swap or an image that changed the card's height. */

/**
 * @param {object} opts
 * @param {HTMLElement} opts.card       the `.sfsa-card` element (starts `hidden`)
 * @param {HTMLElement} [opts.closeBtn] its `.card-close` button
 * @param {() => void} [opts.onClose]   fired AFTER the card hides, on every
 *        close route (button, Escape, programmatic). Clear selection, repaint
 *        the map, mirror URL state here.
 * @param {string} [opts.sheetVar='--sheet-h']  custom property stamped on
 *        <html> with the sheet's rendered height while it is docked. The theme
 *        hooks it in calc() twice: the bottom MapLibre control containers and
 *        the toast both lift by it. Cleared to '0px' on close, which makes
 *        every one of those calc()s inert again.

  /** ESCAPE PRECEDENCE, this card's half of the contract (the other half is
      written out in ui/search.js):

        • a layer ABOVE us already consumed the key → do nothing. ui/search.js
          closes its dropdown with preventDefault + stopPropagation, and a
          modal <dialog> closes itself in the top layer.
        • this card consumes it → close AND preventDefault(), so every layer
          BELOW can tell the key is spoken for.

      That second half is the fix for a real defect: without the
      preventDefault() a single Escape dismissed the card AND the scrim
      underneath it, because a document-level handler further down the page had
      no flag to test — the card read `defaultPrevented` but never set it.
      Anything that listens for Escape below a card MUST check
      `event.defaultPrevented` and stand down when it is true. One Escape
      dismisses exactly one layer, top-down.

      Not stopPropagation(): every one of these handlers is on `document`, and
      stopping propagation between listeners on the SAME node needs
      stopImmediatePropagation(), which would silence layers by registration
      order — the opposite of a stacking contract. The flag is the contract. */
