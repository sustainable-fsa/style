/* ============================================================================
   Sustainable FSA house-style kit · map/map.js · v0.2.1
   MapLibre GL setup for the basemap-less FSA county composite.

   ES module, no build step. Import it pinned to a release:

     import { createCompositeMap, addNavigation, addFitControl,
              installZoomFloor, fitDefault, cameraParams, cameraParamsIfDefault }
       from 'https://sustainable-fsa.com/style/v0.2.1/map/map.js';

   REQUIRES `window.maplibregl` — the vendored UMD build, loaded as a CLASSIC
   script BEFORE the app module:

     <script src="https://sustainable-fsa.com/style/vendor/maplibre-gl-5.18.0/maplibre-gl.js"></script>

   Every entry point asserts that global at first use and throws with that tag
   in the message, because the failure mode otherwise is a blank cream
   rectangle and a `maplibregl is not defined` five frames deep in a callback.

   There is NO basemap (HOUSE-STYLE §7): the county composite IS the map, on a
   brand-cream canvas. Nothing here fetches a tile, needs an API key, or adds
   an attribution bar. Rotation and pitch are off — a rotated composite is
   meaningless and the baked-in Alaska/Hawaii/Puerto Rico insets make it
   actively misleading.

   ── Attribution ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Ported from mt-climate-office/mco-web-style, map/mco-map.js (MIT). The
   zoom-floor hardenings come from mt-climate-office/mesonet-explorer's local
   version of that helper, specced for absorption in mco-web-style's
   CHANGELOG.md § "Planned for 0.7.0". Both kits are MIT.

   Deltas from mco-map.js:

     1. ES module with named exports — no IIFE, no `window.MCO` global.
     2. NO basemap helpers. `themedStyleUrl()`, `cartoStyleUrl()`,
        `addHillshade()`, `TERRARIUM_DEM`, `hillshadePaints()`,
        `firstSymbolLayerId()` and the Montana overlay/tribal-label paints are
        deliberately not ported: this fleet has no tile host and no basemap
        labels to slot under. `blankStyle()` + `createCompositeMap()` replace
        the whole basemap surface.
     3. `MT_FIT_BOUNDS` / `FIT_OPTS` are retired. Bounds come from the decoded
        geometry (`counties.bounds`, county/county.js); `COMPOSITE_BOUNDS`
        below is only a boot-time stand-in for the frames before it arrives.
     4. NEW `cameraParamsIfDefault()` — the clean-URL default-elision pair from
        the same "Planned for 0.7.0" list, shipped as one call rather than a
        separate `atDefaultExtent()` predicate. It compares against the pose a
        fit ACTUALLY settles at inside the maxBounds cage (see § Default pose),
        not against `cameraForBounds()`, which ignores the cage.
     5. `addFitControl()` is a real `IControl` (MCO appends a bare button and
        returns null when no group exists yet), so it survives `removeControl`
        and works before any other control is added — while still FUSING into
        the navigation group when there is one, which is the whole visual
        point.
     6. `installZoomFloor()` bakes in the two mco-0.7.0 hardenings (spring-back
        latch + chrome-only-resize skip) and the `onBeforeSnap` veto.
     7. The reduced-motion gate is imported from core/core.js instead of being
        inlined — this kit's core is an ES module, so there is no dependency
        cost to sharing the one live media query.

/* ── Default pose ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   WHAT THE DEFAULT VIEW ACTUALLY IS, on a caged map.

   `map.cameraForBounds()` ignores `maxBounds`. createCompositeMap() installs a
   cage (`padBounds(bounds, 6)`), and on a wide, short container — the shape of
   every county map in this fleet — the cage holds the camera at a HIGHER zoom
   than the fit alone would land on (measured on the kit demo's 1048×460 map
   container: 3.385 constrained against 2.922 reported; at a full-width
   1440×460 the same pair is 3.846 against 2.926). Comparing the live camera to
   cameraForBounds() therefore never matched on a real house map, so an
   untouched map emitted ?lng&lat&zoom and the clean-URL rule (HOUSE-STYLE §4)
   was broken on arrival.

   The fix is to stop predicting the default pose and start REMEMBERING it: the
   camera is read back at the moveend that concludes a kit fit, which is the
   constrained pose by construction, whatever MapLibre's cage arithmetic did.
   The kit records it

     • at boot, in createCompositeMap(), unless ?lng&lat&zoom named a camera
       (then there is no default pose to record and cameraParamsIfDefault()
       falls back to its old cameraForBounds() comparison);
     • at every fit it performs itself — fitDefault(), the fit control's
       button, and the zoom floor's spring-back;
     • after a container resize that found the camera still at the default
       pose (the cage re-frames silently there, and the pose moves with it);
     • on installZoomFloor()'s refresh(), which re-reads it for the current
       container and INVALIDATES it when it is handed new bounds.

   An app that re-frames the map itself should fit through fitDefault() rather
   than map.fitBounds(), which is the whole of the contract: a raw fitBounds is
   indistinguishable from any other programmatic camera move, so the kit leaves
   the remembered pose alone and the URL keeps the camera. */

   recomputed after (debounced) resizes.

   button at minZoom, so the control greyed out with no explanation. */

 *        bounds and fitOpts may each be a value or a function returning one —
 *        pass a getter and the floor follows the app's live extent with no
 *        refresh at all. onBeforeSnap returning EXACTLY false vetoes the snap.
 *        App policy lives there — "don't yank the camera while a county detail
 *        is open", "a sidebar toggle IS the user asking to re-fit".
 * @returns {{refresh: (newBounds?: any) => void, fitZoom: () => number|undefined,
 *            dispose: () => void}}
 *        refresh() recomputes the fit zoom for the CURRENT container, and
 *        re-reads the remembered default pose when the camera is still sitting
 *        on it. Call it from map.on('load') (cameraForBounds needs a laid-out
 *        container).
 *
 *        refresh(newBounds) ALSO replaces the extent the floor is armed
 *        against — that is the call to make after the first vintage decode
 *        swaps COMPOSITE_BOUNDS for counties.bounds. It invalidates the
 *        remembered default pose with it (the old pose framed the old extent);
 *        the next fitDefault() — or a press of the fit control — records the
 *        new one. A bare refresh() never changes the extent.
